# tree-sitter-queries
> Tree-Sitter queries use with [jcs-emacs](https://github.com/jcs090218/jcs-emacs)

This repository contains custom higlight queries I desire to use to replace
and merge queires from an Emacs package [tree-sitter-langs](https://github.com/ubolonton/tree-sitter-langs).
It will be use with my Emacs configuration, [jcs-emacs](https://github.com/jcs090218/jcs-emacs).

This is will only be use to add queries that does not exists in [tree-sitter-langs/queries](queries).
If it does exist in the `tree-sitter-langs` package; then the entire folder
will be **replaced** with queries under this repository.
