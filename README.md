> Tree-Sitter queries use with [jcs-emacs](https://github.com/jcs090218/jcs-emacs)

This repository contains custom higlight queries I desire to use
to replace and merge queires from an Emacs package [tree-sitter-langs](https://github.com/ubolonton/tree-sitter-langs).
It will be use with my Emacs configuration, [jcs-emacs](https://github.com/jcs090218/jcs-emacs).
